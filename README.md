A Java Sega Genesis emulator made in ARGENTINA.

This is my personal project for learning how to code emulators.

Compability is terrible, status:

-boots some games
-display plane A, B, Window and sprites
-Sprite evaluation
-Scrolling

-No sound
-No accurate cpu and video timings
-Broken Z80 communication
